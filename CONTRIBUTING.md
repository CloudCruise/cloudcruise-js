# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the CloudCruise JavaScript/TypeScript SDK! This guide will help you get started with developing and contributing to this open-source project.

## Project Overview

CloudCruise is the official JavaScript/TypeScript client library for the CloudCruise Platform, providing:

- **Vault management** - Encrypted storage and retrieval of user credentials
- **Workflow execution** - Running automated browser workflows
- **Real-time monitoring** - SSE-based streaming of workflow execution events
- **Webhook handling** - Processing and verification of webhook payloads

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.0.0+ (the project supports Node 18+)
- pnpm (recommended package manager, though npm works too)
- Git

### Installing Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

Or if you prefer npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### Building the Project

```bash
# Build TypeScript to JavaScript
pnpm build

# Or with npm
npm run build
```

### Development Mode

```bash
# Run TypeScript compiler in watch mode
pnpm dev

# Or with npm
npm run dev
```

## Development

### Project Structure

```
src/
├── CloudCruise.ts     # Main client entry point
├── index.ts                 # Package exports
├── vault/                   # Encrypted credential storage
├── workflows/               # Workflow definitions and execution
├── runs/                    # Real-time workflow execution
├── webhook/                 # Webhook processing
└── utils/                   # Shared utilities (SSE, encryption, etc.)
```

### Key Components

- **CloudCruise** - Main entry point that coordinates all functionality
- **VaultClient** - Manages encrypted credential storage with AES-256-GCM
- **WorkflowsClient** - Handles workflow definitions and metadata
- **RunsClient** - Executes workflows with real-time SSE streaming
- **ConnectionManager** - Manages persistent SSE connections with automatic reconnection

## Testing

Run the full test suite before opening a pull request:

```bash
pnpm test

# Or with npm
npm test
```

The test command runs a TypeScript build followed by Node's built-in test runner. Ensure these pass locally before submitting changes.

### Local Package Testing

To test your changes in a real application before submitting a PR:

1. **Build the project**

   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

2. **Create a package**

   ```bash
   pnpm pack
   ```

   This generates a `.tgz` file (e.g., `cloudcruise-0.0.X.tgz`) in the project root.

3. **Install in your test project**

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/test-project
   pnpm add /path/to/cloudcruise-js/cloudcruise-0.0.X.tgz
   ```

4. **Use the local version**
   ```typescript
   import { CloudCruise } from "cloudcruise";
   // Test your changes here
   ```

This workflow allows you to validate that your changes work correctly in real applications before contributing.

## Code Quality

### Current Setup

The project currently uses:

- TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- ES2022 target with ESNext modules
- Type declarations generated automatically

### Code Style Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes)
- Include JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Use ES modules with `.js` extensions in imports
- Maintain existing error handling patterns

## Development Workflow

1. **Fork and Clone**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cloudcruise-js.git
   cd cloudcruise-js
   ```

2. **Create a Feature Branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make Your Changes**

   - Add your code changes
   - Update documentation if needed
   - Add tests for new functionality (when testing framework is available)

4. **Build and Test**

   ```bash
   pnpm build
   pnpm test
   ```

5. **Commit Your Changes**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   ```

6. **Push and Create PR**

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name

   ```

   Then create a pull request on GitHub.

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Provide a clear description of the changes
- Reference any related issues
- Ensure the build passes (`pnpm build` succeeds)
- Follow conventional commit format for commit messages
- Include documentation updates for new features
- Add tests for new functionality

## Publishing Stable Releases

For maintainers preparing an official release:

### Publishing a Stable Release

```bash
# 1. Ensure you're on the main branch and up to date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Build and test the project
pnpm build
pnpm test

# 3. Choose the appropriate semantic version bump
pnpm version patch   # or pnpm version minor | pnpm version major

# 4. Publish with the default "latest" tag
npm publish

# 5. Push the version commit and tag
git push origin main --tags
```

### Post-publish Verification

After publishing, validate the package from a clean environment:

```bash
mkdir /tmp/cloudcruise-release-check
cd /tmp/cloudcruise-release-check
pnpm init -y
pnpm add cloudcruise
```

Confirm the installed package imports correctly and exposes the expected type declarations before announcing the release.
